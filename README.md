# Research Data Management Workshop

This project explores the use of infrastructure as a service, infrastructure automation, version control for the management of research data.  

The project uses [Chef] [3] to provision a server used by a fictional reseacher, a second server hosting a sensor observatory, and a third server for off-site backups.

The presentation using this project can be found [here] [2].  Refer to the [Cybera Rapid Access Cloud] [1] for information on Infrastructure as a Service.
